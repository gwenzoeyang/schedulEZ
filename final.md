SchedulEZ aims to provide Wellesley students with a simpler course planning tool than Workday. The core mission remained consistent from Assignment 2 to the final implementation, but several concepts were modified, some deferred, and new features emerged during development.
[@rmp](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1fGxmxgOHDnb55tPA8pYoUabACtsYzi_D/view?usp=sharing) CourseCatalog was implemented with modifications. The original design included a requirements field for tracking graduation fulfillment, but this was removed when the RequirementTracker concept was deferred. Instead, I added a Rate My Professor link field and course descriptions from MongoDB. The search functionality was expanded beyond the original spec to include filtering by subject, days of the week, and time range, and these features that proved essential for quickly narrowing down options.

Schedule changed significantly from the original server-side design to a client-side localStorage approach. This enabled faster development and offline functionality. The final implementation supports multiple named schedules (e.g., "Plan A", "Plan B"), letting users compare options as shown in my original UI sketches. Rather than blocking course additions when conflicts exist, the app displays overlaps visually on the grid, giving users flexibility to experiment. Bus trips are now stored alongside courses in each schedule.
RequirementTracker was deferred entirely. Wellesley's requirement system varies by major and class year, and accurate implementation would require extensive institutional data that wasn't accessible. This remains a candidate for future work.
[@cross-reg](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1lQ9bZ6bzfwS75IYWeRgZI7Y18od0HZ0H/view?usp=sharing) CrossRegTravel was partially implemented. The original design called for automatic travel time validation that would block infeasible course combinations. Instead, I built a bus schedule panel where users select origin, destination, and days, then manually add trips to their schedule. This approach provides the necessary information while respecting that students may have alternative transportation options the system wouldn't know about.
New Features
[@color](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1RXPFBFrhxb5uk-L3WTadESXrefz5UNOn/view?usp=sharing) Several features emerged that weren't in the original concept design. AI course recommendations let users input their major, interests, and availability, then receive personalized suggestions. The system excludes courses already in the schedule and uses Google's Generative AI for matching. Pastel color coding assigns each course a unique soft color, making it easy to distinguish courses at a glance, which is particularly helpful when courses overlap. It also helps make the courses and schedule grid stand out, which is the most important part of the app. Multiple schedule management lets users create, rename, and switch between different planning options.
UI Changes
The original sketches showed four separate pages: Schedule, Course Details, Alternate Schedule, and Search. The final implementation consolidates everything into a single-page application with three collapsible sidebar panels. The course catalog with search and filters sits on the left, the schedule grid occupies the center, and the bus schedule panel is on the right. Course details appear in a modal overlay rather than a separate page. This design reduces navigation friction and lets users see all relevant information simultaneously.
Synchronizations
The original design specified syncs for travel validation, requirement tracking, and catalog resolution. The final implementation simplified this significantly. Read-only queries like _getAllCourses and _getBusSchedule pass through directly as included routes, while mutation actions are excluded and would require authentication syncs in a production deployment. The RequirementTracker and automatic travel validation syncs were removed along with their parent concepts.
Summary
The final SchedulEZ delivers on the core promise of faster, more intuitive course planning. The main trade-offs involved deferring requirement tracking and replacing automatic travel validation with manual bus scheduling. These decisions kept the project scope manageable while still addressing the primary pain points identified in Assignment 2: Workday's complexity, lack of visualization, and missing professor/course evaluation data.
